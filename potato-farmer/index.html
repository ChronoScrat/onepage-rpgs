            <h1>Hello, Halfling!</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Potato! Potato is a one page RPG created by <a href="https://twitter.com/deathbybadger">Oliver Darkshire</a>.
            In this universe, you are a halfling living your life and farming potatoes while a dark lord rampages across the world. What happens next depends entirely on your luck.</p>
            
            <p>If this is your first time playing this one page RPG, it is recommended that you expand the section bellow and read the rules.</p>

            <button type="button" onclick="showRules()">Show rules</button>

            <div id="rules-box">

                <div id="rules">

                    <div class="close-rule-p"><button type="button" onclick="hideRules()">Hide rules</button></div>

                    <h2>Game rules:</h2>
    
                    <p>You have three scores: <strong>DESTINY</strong>, <strong>POTATOES</strong> and <strong>ORCS</strong>. At the beginning of the game, each of these scores is set at 0.</p>
                    <p>To start the game, you will roll a 1d6 to generate an <i>Event</i>. This Event may or may not add points to one of your scores. <strong>Keep rolling new events until one of the following occurs:</strong></p>
    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>If your <i>DESTINY</i> score reaches 10:</strong> an interfering bard or wizard turns up at your doorstep with a quest, and you are whisked away against your will on an adventure.</li>
                        <li><strong>If your <i>POTATOES</i> score reaches 10:</strong> you have enough potatoes that you can go underground and not return to the surface until the danger is past. You nestle down into your burrow and enjoy your well earned rest.</li>
                        <li><strong>If your <i>ORCS</i> score reaches 10:</strong> orcs finally find your potato farm. Alas, orcs are not so interested in potatoes as they are in eating you, and you end up in a cookpot.</li>
                    </ul>
    
                    <p>At any point in the game, you may choose to sacrifice points in POTATOS to remove 1 pont in ORC. The amount you have to sacrifice starts at 1, but may increase throughout the game.</p>
    
                    <br>
    
                    <p>When you roll the <i>Event</i> dice, the following may happen:</p>
